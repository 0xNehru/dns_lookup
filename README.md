# dns_lookup.py
This Python script performs DNS enumeration on a list of subdomains and checks for potential subdomain takeovers. It queries various DNS records (A, CNAME, MX, NS, TXT, AAAA) and highlights possible takeover vulnerabilities based on known patterns. The results are displayed in a structured table and saved as an Excel file for further analysis.
